## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### **API Integration Architecture**

```typescript
// API Client Configuration
const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
  timeout: 10000,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

// Request Interceptor
apiClient.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    const token = getAuthToken();
    if (token) {
      config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    }
    return config;
  },
  (error) => Promise.reject(error)
);

// Response Interceptor
apiClient.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  async (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      await refreshToken();
      return apiClient.request(error.config);
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

### **Multi-tenant Context Management**

```typescript
// Tenant Context Provider
interface TenantContextType {
  currentTenant: Tenant | null;
  switchTenant: (tenantId: string) => Promise<void>;
  userPermissions: Permission[];
  isMultiTenant: boolean;
}

// Usage in Components
const { currentTenant, switchTenant, userPermissions } = useTenant();
```

### **Error Handling Strategy**

```typescript
// Global Error Handler
const handleApiError = (error: AxiosError) => {
  if (error.response?.status === 403) {
    // Handle permission denied
    showNotification('You do not have permission to perform this action');
  } else if (error.response?.status === 500) {
    // Handle server errors
    showNotification('Server error. Please try again later.');
  } else {
    // Handle other errors
    showNotification('An unexpected error occurred');
  }
};
```

   - **Contingency**: Create API adapters for version differences

2. **Performance Issues**
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching, optimize queries
   - **Contingency**: Scale infrastructure, implement CDN

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - **Mitigation**: Regular security audits, penetration testing
   - **Contingency**: Implement additional security layers

### **Timeline Risks**
1. **Integration Complexity**
   - **Mitigation**: Break down into smaller tasks, parallel development
   - **Contingency**: Extend timeline, prioritize core features

2. **Testing Bottlenecks**
   - **Mitigation**: Implement automated testing, parallel test execution
